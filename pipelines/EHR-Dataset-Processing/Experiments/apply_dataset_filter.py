"""Build and cache every filtered dataset for one (dataset, aggregation) pair.

    python Experiments/apply_dataset_filter.py mimic-iii mean

Run this once per aggregation method before the analysis notebooks — they expect
the caches under Data/<dataset>/<aggregation>/ to already exist. Splitting it out
as a script rather than doing it in the notebook means the expensive part can go
through a job scheduler and be resumed: anything already cached is skipped.

"""Class balancing for the training half of a cross-validation fold.

The cohort is 90.3% negative for mortality (9.66% prevalence, measured on the
`mean` aggregation's 46,032 records), and until now nothing corrected for that at
training time — see `rerun/bug_register.py` entry E-11. The correction lived
entirely at the decision layer, in `pick_threshold`. This module moves it into the
training data instead.

Three strategies, all resampling the *training* rows of one fold only:

    oversample   duplicate real minority rows until the classes match
    undersample  drop real majority rows until the classes match
    smote        interpolate new minority rows between real neighbours

`oversample` and `smote` produce training sets of identical size (2 x n_majority),
so comparing them isolates exactly one question — duplicate an existing patient,
or synthesise a new one.

Pure numpy and sklearn on purpose: no cupy import, so this module can be imported
and self-checked on a login node without `rerun/_cpu_backend.py`. The caller is
responsible for handing in host-side arrays and moving the result back to the
device.

## The zero problem

`RecordEHR.to_tensor()` does `np.nan_to_num(..., nan=0.0)`, so a 0 in the
168-vector means "never measured", not "measured as zero". 39% of the matrix is
those structural zeros (temperature alone is only 23% observed, and 10% of
patients are ~88% missing). Textbook SMOTE breaks on this twice:

1. Interpolating a real heart rate against a structural 0 fabricates a value that
   was never measured and is not physiologically meaningful — 80 bpm blended with
   "missing" gives 40 bpm.
2. Less obvious and worse: plain Euclidean kNN over zero-filled vectors mostly
   measures *missingness-pattern overlap* rather than physiological similarity, so
   the neighbour graph is wrong before any interpolation happens.

`smote_masked` below fixes both. See its docstring for the three rules.

## Provenance

Every strategy returns a `provenance` vector parallel to the balanced rows:
`>= 0` is the source record's position in the arm's row order, `-1` marks a
synthetic row. That is what lets the caller prove no test-fold record — and no
generated point — ever reaches evaluation. The structural guarantee is stronger
than the vector (a synthetic row has no position, so it cannot be written into
`oof_scores`), but the vector is what makes it auditable.

Run `python Managers/balancing_manager.py` for the self-check.

    Returns `(synthetic, parents_local)` where `parents_local` indexes into
    `minority`, or None when the donor pool is too small to interpolate at all
    (fewer than two rows clear `min_observed`). The caller falls back to plain
    oversampling in that case rather than failing the fold.

    Three rules, each fixing a specific way textbook SMOTE misreads this matrix:

    1. **Neighbours are found over co-observed cells only.** 0 is mapped to NaN
       and the search runs under `metric='nan_euclidean'`, which sums squared
       differences across the dimensions both rows observe and rescales by that
       count. Without this the neighbour graph is dominated by whether two
       patients happen to share a measurement schedule.

    2. **The synthetic patient inherits the base parent's measurement schedule.**
       `out` starts as a copy of A, so the generated row has exactly A's
       missingness mask — it never invents a measurement A lacked, and never
       drops one A had. This matters beyond plausibility: missingness here is
       class-correlated (positives are 68.3% observed against 60.1% for
       negatives, because sicker patients get measured more), so the mask is
       itself predictive. Inheriting it keeps that signal intact instead of
       smearing it across classes.

    3. **Interpolation happens only where both parents observed.** Where A
       measured and B did not, A's real value survives untouched; where A did not
       measure, the cell stays 0. So no cell is ever a blend of a reading and a
       structural zero.

    The neighbour search is brute-force (nan_euclidean has no tree support), but
    sklearn chunks `kneighbors` internally so the full pairwise matrix is never
    materialised.
